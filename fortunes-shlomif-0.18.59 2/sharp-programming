   <dazjorz>  :)
   <rindolf>  dazjorz: yes, I are here.

   <rindolf>  dazjorz: this is about programming in general.
   <rindolf>  At least theoretically.

              <Zuu>  yeah, it kinda have a girlish sound to it
          <dazjorz>  rindolf: call yourself shloma, dutch people will
                     think you're over sixty and female
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: heh.
          <dazjorz>  let me rephase that
          <dazjorz>  dutch people will think you're female... and over
                     sixty
          <dazjorz>  (oma = grandma)
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: ah.
           <unreal>  kloot.
          <rindolf>  In Hebrew nouns that end with "ah" tend to be
                     feminine.
          <dazjorz>  shlomah?
          <rindolf>  Seriously now, if I change my nick it will be to
                     shlomif.
          <dazjorz>  let's change our nicks at the same time
          <rindolf>  Well, in Shlomi's case it would be Shlomith.
          <dazjorz>  I will be sjors, you will be shlomif
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: OK.
                  *  rindolf is now known as shlomif
          <dazjorz>  shit, now I have to
              <Zuu>  what does shlimif even mean ?
                  *  dazjorz is now known as sjors
            <sjors>  Zuu: shlomi = his first name, f = the first letter of
                     his last name
          <shlomif>  sjors: hi.
          <shlomif>  Zuu: shlomi fish.
            <sjors>  hi shlomif
          <shlomif>  Hi sjors
 <tommy_the-dragon>  where does rindolf come into it?
          <shlomif>  sjors: my nick is longer than yours.
              <Zuu>  oh lol, and i just said his name sound girly :P
                  *  Zuu pat pats shlomif ^^
          <shlomif>  tommy_the-dragon: Rindolf was a dwarven warrior I
                     played in AD&D.
 <tommy_the-dragon>  ahh ok
                  *  shlomif gives Zuu his tomato back.
              <Zuu>  :<
          <shlomif>  Since I'm no longer a reindeer.
            <sjors>  shlomif: that's just to compensate against something
                     you have that's way shorter than mine
          <shlomif>  sjors: LOL.
          <shlomif>  sjors++

 <tommy_the-dragon>  sorry...

              <Zuu>  Hehe
                  *  shlomif doesn't like raw tomatoes.
          <shlomif>  But I eat them with pasta, etc.
          <shlomif>  Or as meat sauce.
              <Zuu>  or in sandwiches
          <shlomif>  sjors: anyway, welcome to ##programming
              <Zuu>  or on reindeer nose
          <shlomif>  sjors: I'll probably revert to "rindolf" after next
                     disconnect.
          <shlomif>  Zuu: after you cook the entire reindeer.
                  *  shlomif is a reindeer cannibal.
          <shlomif>  Well, rindolf is.
              <Zuu>  yes, but he ran away
          <shlomif>  I also like dried and olive oiled tomatoes.
            <sjors>  shlomif: I just changed my clients' settings to
                     reconnect as sjors, too
          <shlomif>  Well, I think I'll go to sleep.
          <shlomif>  sjors: ah.
            <sjors>  shlomif: it'll probably take a while to "adapt" to
                     sjors instead of dazjorz
          <shlomif>  sjors: well, enjoy your new nick.
            <sjors>  and I still have dazjorz.com, and not sjors.anything
                  *  Zuu tugs shlomif in
            <sjors>  thanks ;)
          <shlomif>  Zuu: thanks.
                  *  Zuu quicly squeeses a fresh tomato onto shlomif's
                     nose
            <sjors>  shlomif: sjors.biz and sjors.mobi at most
                  *  shlomif doesn't have rindolf.{com,org,net} etc.
          <shlomif>  sjors: maybe sjors.in
          <shlomif>  I got a shlom.in
            <sjors>  sjors.indahou.se
          <shlomif>  sjors: heh.
            <sjors>  sjors.ac, sjors.ag, sjors.am, sjors.at
            <sjors>  hehe sjors.me
            <sjors>  sjors.pl, too bad i don't really do perl anymore
          <shlomif>  sjors: there's also .sh
            <sjors>  sjors.sh, too bad I don't really do shell script a
                     lot
          <shlomif>  Or .im
            <sjors>  sjors.tv, too bad I don't really watch..
 <tommy_the-dragon>  do you own a mobile?
          <shlomif>  .tv are pretty costly.
            <sjors>  meh I don't like sjors. anyway, so I'll just keep
                     dazjorz for everything
 <tommy_the-dragon>  yeah whats with that (the price of .tv)?
          <shlomif>  tommy_the-dragon: it's the foundation of the economy

           *  Zuu solves rindolf
   <rindolf>  Zuu: http://fc-solve.berlios.de/
   <rindolf>  Zuu: I am not solvable.
   <rindolf>  I am Turing hard.
       <Zuu>  :S
           *  Zuu never heard of anything called 'turing hard'
 <joeyadams>  lol. Zuu's probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.
       <Zuu>  but i guess i have now
 <joeyadams>  Formal definition of Turing hard: blah blah blah hard blah
              blah Turing blah.
       <Zuu>  Hahahaha :D
 <joeyadams>  Wikipedia: Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called
              Turing hard for X if X <=_T A for all X in X. If
              additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for
              X.
 <joeyadams>  Does that clarify?
 <joeyadams>  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the
              actual math symbols)
           *  joeyadams assumes you get the point
       <Zuu>  yeah, i think i'll have to put significant time into that,
              for me to comprehend it :)
       <Zuu>  but maybe i will, some day :P
 <joeyadams>  My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe
              more concise mumbo jumbo.
 <joeyadams>  E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all
              the problems in NP.
       <Zuu>  i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that
              rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his
              ability to be solved
 <joeyadams>  I'm guessing Turing-hard means you can't solve a problem
              with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)
 <joeyadams>  (substitute Turing machine with "your computer" :) )
       <Zuu>  no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness
 <joeyadams>  okay, Zuu > joeyadams, so I can't help you :)
           *  Zuu tickles joeyadams ^^
 <joeyadams>  A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as
              tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.
 <joeyadams>  In other words, apples are in the set of recursively
              nommable fruits.
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: what's up?
 <joeyadams>  I'm babbling.
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.
           *  Zuu watches a number of apples that recursively NOM's
              eathother
   <rindolf>  It tends to be too commonplace.
   <rindolf>  Or simpleton.
 <joeyadams>  whoops, my logic is incorrect
 <joeyadams>  Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.
 <joeyadams>  (recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)
           *  Zuu NOMs joeyadams :>
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is
              his favourite fruit.
   <rindolf>  Ta-zuu!
           *  joeyadams has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by
              peer))
       <Zuu>  yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of
              words to sound smart :/
       <Zuu>  my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!
 <joeyadams>  although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to
              solve complex problems. As Aristophanes said, "High thoughts
              must have high language."
       <Zuu>  .. along with immutable polymorphic pears
 <joeyadams>  Zuu> I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?
 <joeyadams>  lol
       <Zuu>  Hahah, yeah :P
 <joeyadams>  I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.
       <Zuu>  i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space

     <Zuu>  i think you have forgottoen to define the #intro anchor
 <rindolf>  Zuu: reload.
 <rindolf>  Zuu: it's there.
     <Zuu>  hah, caches... :P
     <Zuu>  :D
 <rindolf>  Pesky things.
 <rindolf>  Evil reindeers don't like caches.
 <rindolf>  Neither do cats.
 <rindolf>  I'm an evil reindeer but a good cat.
     <Zuu>  Hehe
 <rindolf>  Don't know how it works.
 <rindolf>  I guess good and evil are relative.

      <Zuu>  Hi rindolf :)
  <rindolf>  Hi Zuu
  <rindolf>  Zuu: I've been thinking that maybe you can find some
             corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different
             dimension.
      <Zuu>  hmmm... interresting!
  <rindolf>  Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?
      <Zuu>  Im not sure what sex I am.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  :P
  <rindolf>  Zuu: you can look.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: in the mirror or something.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: don't you have obligatory genders in Danish/
  <rindolf>  ?
  <rindolf>  Like in German, French, etc.
  <rindolf>  Or Hebrew and Arabic.
      <Zuu>  obligatory genders?
      <Zuu>  you mean, the genders in linguistics?
          *  Zuu never understood those
      <Zuu>  but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly
             there is female and 'none'
  <rindolf>  Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.
      <Zuu>  i dont remember what which is which though :P
  <rindolf>  Like in Hebrew "Haben Halakh lagan" - the boy went to the
             garden. "Habath Halkha lagan" - "The girl went to the garden"
 <c_sphere>  That almost sounds like allah akbar
      <Zuu>  rindolf, no we dont distinct between the genders of the
             subject in the danish language
      <Zuu>  our nouns have genders though
 <c_sphere>  zuu-nina?
      <Zuu>  like 'house' is one gender and 'car' is another
  <rindolf>  Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak
             natively?
 <c_sphere>  rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!
  <rindolf>  Zuuish?
 <c_sphere>  The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.
      <Zuu>  so if you want to say 'the house' its 'huse_t_' and if you
             want to say 'the car' its 'bile_n_'
  <rindolf>  c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is "Hares" (the
             Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: can you understand Swedish?
 <c_sphere>  Aemeth
      <Zuu>  rindolf, some :)
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  swedish branched from danish afaik
      <Zuu>  same with norwegian
      <Zuu>  yes, Zuu's speak Zuuish nativley :P
          *  rindolf is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  Zuuish have few words, all of which is based on words about
             cake from othre languages :P
      <Zuu>  c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word "עוגיה" (= `ugiyah,
             cookie) for?
  <rindolf>  "Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!"
      <Zuu>  i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P
  <rindolf>  What does it mean in Zuuish?
      <Zuu>  it's hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can
             really do is say something equivalent to "COOKIES!!"
      <Zuu>  or "YAY CAKE!"
      <Zuu>  basically, you can only express excitement over different
             kinds of cakes :P
  <rindolf>  Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?
      <Zuu>  There was this one time...
      <Zuu>  wait.. no. That was someone else.

  <rindolf>  Chekov: I disagere with what ESR says in TAOUP that you
             shouldn't apply factor optimisations. I think they can make a
             very large difference.
  <rindolf>  Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are
             fast enough.
  <rindolf>  Problem is people don't want to upgrade and if a competing
             program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them
             will switch.
  <rindolf>  Programs being speedy is one thing that makes me happy.

  <rindolf>  And I enjoy the fact that Pidgin is much faster than Kopete
             (and also less buggy).
  <rindolf>  I've used Kopete for far too long.
  <osoleve>  rindolf: switch to Irssi and Bitlbee! :D
  <rindolf>  vanguard: yes.
  <rindolf>  vanguard: though they failed on Google Wave.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: nah, I like Pidgin.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: it's fast enough for me.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: and I also prefer XChat.
  <osoleve>  but is it nerdy enough?
  <rindolf>  osoleve: I'm not trying to be a Ubergeek.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: real men use Xmonad!
 <vanguard>  Hey, it is not Uber but Über ... :D
  <rindolf>  real programmers use butterflies.

        <wes_>  tell me how can u print a message without using a

     <rindolf>  wes_: in C?
     <rindolf>  wes_: do you mean the printf(...) statement?
        <wes_>  yes
     <rindolf>  wes_: you cannot without using macros I think.
     <rindolf>  wes_: and don't use macros for that.
        <wes_>  i mean without using a semicolon at the printf statement
                but you have to use printf only

     <rindolf>  amigojapan: that's not fair trade.
     <rindolf>  But I'll treasure the whitespace.
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: a whitespace is just as valuable as a semicolon
                in python :)
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: aren't semicolons optional in Py?
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: I think they are
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: actually, a whitespace can be as valuable as 2
                curly braces :)
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: heh.
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: you need 4 spaces to distinguish stuff
                properly.
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: one thing I never got about python is why they

  <amigojapan>  rindolf: the fact that you dont have a rule to how much

     <rindolf>  marzy: Emacs is not a better vim. They are very different.
     <rindolf>  marzy: I could never get used to Emacs, but have used Vim
                for many years.
       <marzy>  rindolf Emacs + Evil mode makes a better vim
     <rindolf>  marzy: does it support all Vim extensions?
       <marzy>  no, that's why its better. it doesn't come with retarded
                scripting language!!
     <rindolf>  marzy: well, it's still not 100% compatible with vim.
     <rindolf>  marzy: and Evil is an awful name. Sorry.
     <rindolf>  "The only thing more evil than XSLT is XSLT edited with
                Emacs Evil mode." ;-)
       <marzy>  i think it's a good name considering emacs and vi(m)
                rivalry
     <rindolf>  marzy: of course, I've heard worse - coq and coccinelle.
     <rindolf>  And then there's this guy here who called his programming
                language Flua which reminds me of Flu and Influenza.
 <Reactionary>  rindolf: lol
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, flua IDE is not that bad to be fair (at least the
                little i tried )
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: didn't say *it* was bad - I said the name was
                bad.
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: and I could never get it running here.
                Problems with Py3 and PyQt.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, oh that sucks... :/
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: yes.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, yeah i know you didn't said it was bad, just as
                gave you my opinion on it as a side note. sorry i should
                have made it more explicit :)
     <rindolf>  Of course, Evil is not as bad a name as SLIME, which is
                another Emacs mode.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, i had troubles with SLIME once and boy i got
                tired of fighting with it
     <rindolf>  Reportedly it was also the nickname of an internal
                Microsoft version control system called SLM (that is now
                largely discontinued).

 <codescience>  just stumbled across another question. is there an
                open-source license that prevent anyone from making money
                off my code?
     <rindolf>  codescience: no there isn't.
     <rindolf>  codescience: it stands against the open source definition.
        <ssta>  codescience: that would violate the spirit of what most
                people understand "open source" to mean
     <rindolf>  codescience: people can sell copies of open source
                software or services related to it.
 <codescience>  hmmm, i understand
     <rindolf>  codescience: see
                http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html
        <ssta>  I can legally sell you this copy of the linux kernel...I
                can charge whaqtever you are willing to pay. Nothing in
                the license prevents this
     <rindolf>  ssta: will you sell it to me for 5,000 USD?
     <rindolf>  ;-)
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure
     <rindolf>  ssta: how about for 3,000 USD?
        <ssta>  rindolf: tell you what, for $10,000 I'll throw in a free
                copy of FreeBSD
     <rindolf>  ssta: wow, sounds like a good deal.
        <ssta>  rindolf: hmm, 3000 is a bit low, I don't think I could go
                that cheap
     <rindolf>  ssta: heh.
     <rindolf>  ssta: how much are you selling the source code of Apache
                2.4 for?
        <ssta>  rindolf: oh, you can have that for free
     <rindolf>  ssta: really?
     <rindolf>  Sucker!
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure...but the build scripts you have to pay for
     <rindolf>  ssta: OK.
     <rindolf>  ssta: would you be willing to exchange the source of the
                Linux kernel for three copies of jQuery? I will even throw
                in a few free Dojo plugins.
     <rindolf>  ssta: he already told us.
        <ssta>  rindolf: hmm, not sure I want jQuery
        <ssta>  rindolf: would you happen to have code for a halfway
                decent RDBMS? I think I could swap for that
     <rindolf>  ssta: I have the source code for MySQL. Not sure if it's
                half-decent.
 <codescience>  i run a mysql server. runs good enough for me
        <ssta>  rindolf: I use MySQL in production quite a lot. It has its
                flaws, but my use cases never seem to hit them
     <rindolf>  ssta: OK.
     <rindolf>  ssta: so will you exchanges its source code for the Linux
                kernel?
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure
     <rindolf>  ssta: sounds good.
     <rindolf>  ssta: you can find the source code of MySQL here -
                http://www.mysql.com/
        <ssta>  rindolf: you can get the linux source from kernel.org
     <rindolf>  ssta: thanks.

 <doomrobo>  rindolf, I got redirected to your gcc important flags page
             today and I think you may be missing a few things
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: do you mean the one in the talk?
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: which page are you referring to?
 <doomrobo>  rindolf, lemme see
  <rindolf>  http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/W2L/Development/slides/gcc/flags.html
             - heh, first Google hit for "gcc important flags"
  <rindolf>  At least for me.
 <doomrobo>  yeah
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: OK, I did not originate that page originally.
 <doomrobo>  ok
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: and it served a certain purpose as material for
             slides to the Haifa Linux Club's Welcome to Linux series.
 <doomrobo>  nice
          *  jrslepak always found it funny that -Wall doesn't turn on all

     <tnzr>  does anyone happen to know what std::allocator.allocate()
             does when you try to allocate 0 bytes? I get a pointer back
             but I can't tell what it's pointing at and I can't seem to
             find anything on the web that gives a difinitive answer
   <GeDaMo>  Why are you allocating zero bytes?
 <Billiard>  tnzr: the same thing it always returns
     <tnzr>  GeDaMo: we are implementing our own allocator for an
             assignment, and when asked what we should do if the user
             tries to allocate 0 bytes, the prof said to find out what
             std::allocator does and mimic that
   <GeDaMo>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6065814/standard-compliant-custom-allocator
     <tnzr>  oh snap, thanks GeDaMo
   <GeDaMo>  :)
  <rindolf>  GeDaMo: zero bytes are enough to hold the Complete Works of
             Shakespeare.
   <GeDaMo>  Depends on how many monkeys you have to decompress it :P
  <rindolf>  GeDaMo: heh.
  <rindolf>  Of course, I defined a custom decompressor that emits the
             complete works of Shakespeare on empty input and uses gzip
             compression otherwise.
  <rindolf>  It's pretty large though.
 <Billiard>  redeemed: compress the decompressor using the same algo
 <Billiard>  errr rindolf
  <rindolf>  Billiard: OK.
  <rindolf>  Billiard: heh.
 <Billiard>  0 bytes = a decompressor for the entire works of shakespeare

 <famously>  this is going to take half the night
 <Textmode>  sapphire Sundays
  <rindolf>  Pearl Mondays.
  <rindolf>  Diamond Saturdays.
 <famously>  YES!
 <famously>  diamond saturday definitely
 <famously>  i thought the same thing
 <famously>  i guess there's already a gemstone for every month, so this
             would be seen as kind of a ripoff
 <famously>  maybe a metal for every day
