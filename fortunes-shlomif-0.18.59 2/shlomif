A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation,
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is also
forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutton
as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different beasts). Finally,
chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not be eaten along with
any mammal’s milk either.

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it would
have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by Microsoft’s tremendous
desire to advance its Internet Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that they
switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as Microsoft
Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested that
the Windows’ manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be
designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this project
is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a large
momentum soon.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School.

What most people think is something like that:

<<<

The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one
place, and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people,
because he feared they’ll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of
Language Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and
without being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across
the Earth. God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get to the bottom of a

inside it. I asked my question and soon afterwards received:

* One Thunderbird recommendation.

* Two Evolution recommendations.

* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.

* One GMail recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was
completely out of the question due to my work’s constraints.

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode’s #debian channel, where there are many knowledgeable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw.

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

 <trashguy>  atleast the variabls are obvious and not mistaken for

 <elgrande>  i stringly recommend to call variables only: var1, var2, var3

             only: var1, var2, var3 ... var999 - excellent advice.
  <rindolf>  elgrande: LOL.
 <elgrande>  rindolf: and of course: cls1, func1, meth1, if1

A: You Linux kids are so lucky. When we were using Windows 95 and Windows 3.11
it kept getting stuck and we lost all our data. We had to reboot it.

B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age, we used DOS on CGA

environment.

C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was your age, I used
VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128 characters should be enough for
everybody?

D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes on a PDP-11: the
computer printed on paper - very slowly. Can you imagine cat’ing a really long
document?

E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I was using. Imagine
going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then
dropping them all.

F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We input machine code
directly using buttons and LEDs.

     <rindolf>  scorchsaber+=1
       <rillo>  ??
     <rindolf>  rillo: Python does not have a ++ operator.
 <scorchsaber>  rindolf: Oh, but it does have a + operator.
       <rillo>  ah. i'm new to python so i diddnt know
 <scorchsaber>  A few days ago, it was suggested that I implement ++ using
                the + operator.
 <scorchsaber>  And I did so. :)
 <scorchsaber>  So, really, a++; is valid in Python, and it may even
                increment a by one. If somebody was crazy, anyhow, and if
                a was mutable.
       <rillo>  shall i move back to perl to get the ++
       <rillo>  ?

   <rindolf>  TimToady: so BASIC was your first language?
  <TimToady>  no, English was my first language. :)
   <rindolf>  TimToady: I started with XT ROM BASIC, but I suppose it was
              something like Perl 5 was to Perl 4 for your BASIC.
   <rindolf>  BASIC has greatly evolved since Dartmouth BASIC.
   <rindolf>  TimToady: ah.
   <rindolf>  TimToady: not Chomsky's Universal language?

     <Juerd>  21:04 <@TimToady> we have a test suite right now because of

     <Juerd>  Very, very important.
   <rindolf>  diakopter: I don't know.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: yes, very.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: anyway, I expect that at every given time all tests
              will pass.
     <Juerd>  Well, there are probably bad tests too :)
     <Juerd>  Given the volume of the suite, and that pugs has never been

   <rindolf>  How long does it take Pugs to run the entire Pugs test
              suite?

   <rindolf>  Because Pugs is kinda slow.

  <TimToady>  first make it run, then make it run right, then make it run
              fast
   <rindolf>  TimToady: another problem with Pugs is that it kept
              requiring the latest ghc.

  <pmurias>  rindolf: what is Park/Spark?
  <rindolf>  pmurias:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Park-Lisp/
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's still incomplete.
  <rindolf>  And I haven't updated it.
  <pmurias>  rindolf: if you like lisp/perl6 projects you might consider
             helping with a common lisp elf backend
  <rindolf>  pmurias: Common Lisp.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: thing is I think both CL and Scheme suck.
  <rindolf>  I like Lisp as a concept.
  <rindolf>  Arc is nice, but has too many implementation problems.
  <rindolf>  And missing features.
    <vixey>  Arc is not nice
  <rindolf>  I want to give a presentation to the Perl Mongers about
             "Foreign Languages: Lisp"
  <rindolf>  vixey: I like it.
  <rindolf>  Though I hate that "(not)" has become "(no)"
  <rindolf>  it's so non-English.
    <vixey>  it's just TCL with horrible syntax
  <rindolf>  vixey: but it's missing a lot of exciting features.
  <rindolf>  Which PG deemed as unnecessary.
  <rindolf>  Doesn't look like the 100-years language to me.
  <rindolf>  Which is why - Spark!
  <pmurias>  why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?
  <rindolf>  pmurias: could be.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's another approach.
  <rindolf>  But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.
  <rindolf>  For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list
             concat.
  <rindolf>  While Python does and it seems to be OK in Arc too.
  <rindolf>  And in CL you have (concatenate) (yuck!).
  <pbuetow>  (((hehe)))
  <pmurias>  + for strings sucks
    <Auzon>  seconded.
    <vixey>  rindolf: If you don't like CONCATENATE you can just rename it
  <rindolf>  vixey: yeah.
  <rindolf>  vixey: but I'd rather not rename concatenate because then
             people won't understand my code.
  <rindolf>  vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.
    <vixey>  yes they will rindolf
  <rindolf>  They want things to work out of the box.
    <vixey>  A program is many many totally newly defined procedures
    <vixey>  just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big
             program
  <rindolf>  vixey: "let's spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day
             implementing the solution with it."
 <TimToady>  if it would take 10 days without the new language, it's worth
             it
  <rindolf>  TimToady: yeah.
  <rindolf>  TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.
    <vixey>  no it's not
  <rindolf>  Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.
    <vixey>  CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that
  <rindolf>  vixey: I meant a common idiom there.
  <rindolf>  I think I'll /quit and do something productive.
  <rindolf>  Like work on Spark.
    <vixey>  another quote:
    <vixey>  how to write any computer program in two easy stages:
    <vixey>  Design and implement the programming language which would be
             best for solving the problem.
    <vixey>  Write the program in the language you’ve just implemented.
  <rindolf>  vixey: or just use Perl which is the best for everything.
    <vixey>  heh
 <TimToady>  the second step is obvious--the best language for the job is
             one that does the job on a null input
          *  pmichaud notes that vixey's algorithm is somewhat recursive
 <TimToady>  "All rules of thumb are false, including this one."
  <pmurias>  rindolf: when you feel like writing Common Lisp backends,
             contact me or mncharity ;)

you know.

Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in a conference I was

They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures, but besides of that
- they are quite a trusted service.

Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new editor, "Emacs" on
the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99. In order to package it, he invokes
the trusty ol’ module-starter (see
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates a skeleton of a
CPAN distribution for him.

He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types "perl Build.PL",
and "./Build test" and makes sure all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build
config --gui" and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the
Module meta-data.[M-B-Data]

In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and selects
categories. This is done in a similar way to Freshmeat’s project
categorisation dialog (a list of options to the left, with selected options to
the right and arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
select options.). He chooses such categories as "Programming Language ::
Lisp", and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and
"Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be fetched using
a public web-service to keep them up-to-date.)

After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has received many
patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now Emacs is not only an editor
but a calendar tool, an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and
many other things.

So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
categorisation. He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds more categories.
However, he enters too many categories (because Emacs now does them all), and
the GUI refuses to save the file because it will overflow the limit that the
web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to handle. So
Richard keeps only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves it.

He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new distribution to the
CPAN.

Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman’s Emacs as the
basis of his company’s state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macros™ is a
commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores,
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends
patches to Richard and learns a lot about it.

When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he surfs to the Emacs
homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.

Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

PHP error debug list:

1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good programmer, use
the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you’re not a
good programmer, or you learned php’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).

2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. php will do it for you so you
can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into
your sql queries.

  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I played with Squeak a little and yes I'd like
             a vim clone written in perl.
  <Makoryu>  Why isn't there one already, then?
  <Makoryu>  (A vim clone in Perl)
  <Su-Shee>  good question. there's one in javascript :)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: actually , it's a vi clone.
  <rindolf>  Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.
  <rindolf>  Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing
             a Perl 6 implementation.
  <rindolf>  Unless you're Chuck Norris.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?
  <moritz_>  no, he scared K&R into writing it ;-)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire
             Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack
             breaks.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I know - he published slackware under the
             pseudonym patrick volkerding...
  <rindolf>  Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.
   <araujo>  the second time includes fixing all its errors
  <moritz_>  but he didn't commmit his changes, it seems
  <rindolf>  moritz_: heh.
  <rindolf>  LOL.
   <araujo>  Chuck Norris doesn't commit changes, the changes commit for
             him
   <araujo>  :)
  <rindolf>  Code is too scared of Chuck to be wrong.
  <rindolf>  It is generated right in the first time.
  <rindolf>  Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris' computer.
  <Su-Shee>  .o(I see a chuck norris release on the horizon... ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: :-)
  <Su-Shee>  we could ask chuck norris if he's willing to promote the star
             release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to
             laughter.. :)
   <araujo>  Perl 6 - A Chuck Norris like language
 <dukeleto>  Chuck Norris has actually been using Perl 6 since 1987, and

  <Su-Shee>  rakudo - chuck's choice ;)
  <Su-Shee>  well, camelia and chuck norris go well together. ;)
  <rindolf>  OK.
  <rindolf>  Of course everybody know Chuck Norris is a real programmer.
  <rindolf>  He designs machines by combining individual atoms.
  <rindolf>  Using his thought.
  <rindolf>  Atoms obey Chuck Norris.

 <shlomif>  Larry Wall seems a bit less funny on IRC than on Usenet or

 <shlomif>  But he's not always funny.
 <shlomif>  IRL, he's really funny.
 <shlomif>  He gives funny presentations.
   <sjors>  I don't have the place in ottd to *force* them to do the right
            thing, but they do stuff like making 90 degree corners,
            stopping three other trains in their tracks, just because it's

 <whoppix>  Quick git question, perhaps someone knows the answer: I have a
            file in my git tree (locally and in the repository), but I
            want git to ignore the file completely, i.e. git is not to
            touch the file on the filesystem by updating it or merging
            local changes into the repostiroy
 <rindolf>  whoppix: you can use .gitignore
 <rindolf>  I think
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hmm, good idea, thanks.
 <whoppix>  that was slow.
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hm, I think git update-index --assume-unchanged is
            what I need.
 <whoppix>  .gitignore is only for untracked files
 <rindolf>  whoppix: OK, have no clue what that is.
 <rindolf>  Git is so complicated.
 <rindolf>  And so opaque
 <whoppix>  rindolf, me neither, but the doc tells me to use that.
 <rindolf>  whoppix: can you believe the docs?
 <rindolf>  The docs may be lying.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust the docs.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust anything.

            above modules are adopted.

Mike “The Mouse” House (a.k.a “D.J. Salinger”) was a minor rap artist, and a
computer geek when he decided to start selling CDs of open-source software. He
turned to spamming to publicise his business, but found out that the spam he
sent was trapped by most spam traps. He decided to use the notorious obscured
image spam, but since he had a few blind friends, decided to also include an
audio recording of a rap song with the spam message.

House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his real break came
when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it on the Internet, where it
became an instant hit. The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made
D.J. Salinger famous, who quickly released his first successful album called
/Rap to the spam, Ma’am!/, with such highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to not get
trapped” and “He ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.

As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money back to sponsoring
open-source projects, and has donated 100,000’s of U.S. Dollars to such causes
as [the Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), [Linux
International](http://www.li.org/) and
[SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/). “If it hadn’t been for them,
I wouldn’t have made it big”, he said, and said he’s now working on a second
album with a similar theme.

All languages of the world suck. If you require people to declare variables
(like in Pascal, C,
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) or
Perl 5 with [strict](http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html)), then people will
tell you they like variables to spring up upon first use. Without variable
declarations, then you get various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping.
If you use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more and there’s
more clutter. With indentation-based scoping (like in Python), you’ll find it
hard to introduce multiple-expression
[lambdas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions).

Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming (OOP) and so they
didn’t introduce it in their
[“Go”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) and
[“Arc“](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29)
languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess what? Many people,
including me, think that OOP is still a good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++
did not do OOP very well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
closely at Go.

Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or Lisp) possibly
suffer from many subtle errors ; Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are
less expressive and it seems that about one third of the language design
papers published on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) are
about various funky extensions to the Haskell type system to allow for better
expressiveness.

Purely functional languages have no assignment and most people find them
harder, in part because the world around us has a lot of state, and they also
need to do funky compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and so are prone to
many errors.

If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions or Perl 5’s “last
LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to
not be factored correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers will
hate you for having to go through many hoops to write quick-and-dirty code.

Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is treated magically by
the parser. PHP and Java use strings for them, and require weird escaping and
backslashing rules to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions, then people will
want similar first-order syntaxes for XPath, for XML (like some recent
versions of Visual Basic .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need
to embed.

Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created by the leading
[sigils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29) of
Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but they allow for much
better backward compatibility, facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (=
embedding inside strings), and also give some important visual cues when
skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).

about Roles. And Moose! And Roles in Moose! And Moose in Roles! And Roles

          <rindolf>  Hi all.
         <Leuthihi>  O HAI rindolf
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: HAI HAI.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: what's up?
         <Leuthihi>  rindolf: I'm hungry!
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: there's one antidote for it.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: it's called Food.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: </bolt>
         <Leuthihi>  well, but what food?
         <Leuthihi>  and I need coffee
         <Leuthihi>  oh, I think I know what I'll have.
 <benwbrum_chez_so>  Chili. A big bowl of red, with crackers and onions on
                     the side.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: does it matter?
            <Volis>  If it has to be some cuisine.
            <Volis>  Did I spell correctly?
          <rindolf>  Volis: spell what?
            <Volis>  oh yes.
            <Volis>  cuisine.
          <rindolf>  "cuisine" is spelt this way.
          <rindolf>  Yes.
          <rindolf>  It's a French word I think.
          <rindolf>  .ety cuisine
           <la_fen>  "1786, from Fr. cuisine 'style of cooking,'
                     originally 'kitchen, cooking, cooked food' (12c.),
                     from L.L. cocina, earlier coquina 'kitchen,' from L.
                     coquere 'to cook' (see cook (n.))." -
                     http://etymonline.com/?term=cuisine
          <rindolf>  OK, originally from Latin.
            <Volis>  nevermind. Which cuisine is the best?
            <Volis>  In general
          <rindolf>  Volis: I like many cuisines.
           <Gvidon>  Russian, of course
          <rindolf>  Volis: though most of the ethnic food is actually
                     poor men's food.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: Russian cuisine?
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Yes
         <Leuthihi>  well, yes, because I need something to eat to be able
                     to eat it.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: what does it feature?
            <Volis>  Russian cuisine lacks flavour.
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Vodka
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: ah.
         <Leuthihi>  In Soviet Russia, food tastes YOU!
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: I didn't know Vodka is nutritious
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: :-)
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, They no longer use this meme. :P
         <Leuthihi>  Vodka has plenty of calories at least.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: and I don't consume Alcoholic beverages in
                     any quantity.
          <rindolf>  Volis: :-)
         <Leuthihi>  Volis: because: In Soviet Russia, meme uses You!
          <rindolf>  «In Soviet Russia, cats own you. Oh wait! They own
                     you everywhere.»
            <Volis>  Considering the fact, i'm still underage. Please
                     change the topic.
          <rindolf>  Volis: underage?
          <rindolf>  Volis: ah, you cannot drink?
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, left keeps you. Always.
            <Volis>  "Dear fellow driver, let left be for communist crap
                     only"
            <Volis>  rindolf, Rules of the world.

 <linuxguy101>  sebsebseb: i thought you were abducted by windows 8
     <rindolf>  sebsebseb: hi.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: windows got him
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: if you say so.
 <linuxguy101>  he is trying to find that icon in windows 8 that has irc
                on it
 <linuxguy101>  average users it usually will take a day or longer
 <linuxguy101>  it is a productivity enhancer
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: heh.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must get windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  it is an experience in windows you will never forget
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: why?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: it is like windows me and vista combined with a
                bunch of retarded programmers who cant speak the same lang
 <linuxguy101>  it is jaw dropping
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: sounds fascinating.
 <linuxguy101>  i expect Microsoft will earn some rewards on this os
 <linuxguy101>  like longest boot time.. Hardest os to use by a human. And
                most compatible os with itself ever made.
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: :-)
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must switch to something less useful and more
                productive like windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  think of the hours you could spend on windows 8.. remember
                it is retro
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: retrofitted?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: yes.. down to 2 or 4 colors.. steve balmer in a
                cocaine brain storming meeting with the developers decided
                to move to a gui that was un pattoned so they invented
                retro.. simple and stupid colors a 4 year old child could
                barely read or draw
 <linuxguy101>  he called it retro
     <rindolf>  Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  clearly a first in computing history
     <rindolf>  Now I get the joke.
     <rindolf>  Metro is Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  oh it is no joke.. just wait for windows 8 lack of sales
                prompt stever balmer to shove it down into the updates for
                windows 7
 <linuxguy101>  on a side note, did you know that linux is becoming more
                popular now days?
 <linuxguy101>  i dont know why..
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you really should try windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  at least virtual box it..
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: maybe I should, but I'm not going to shell
                out money for the experience.
 <linuxguy101>  Warning!: using windows 8 may cause massive hysteria,
                laughing and vomiting in some cases..
 <linuxguy101>  the first time i used windows 8 i laughed uncontrolably
                for several hours and almost wet myself

 <rindolf>  Hi all.
 <srogers>  howdy
 <rindolf>  srogers: hi, what's up?
 <srogers>  work, mostly
 <srogers>  "one of those days"
 <rindolf>  Ah.
 <rindolf>  Work.
 <rindolf>  I'm enjoying my unemployed status.
 <rindolf>  And after all that hospital thing is behind me, I'd like to go
            to tau.ac.il and set up some events where I read from my
            writings/etc.
 <rindolf>  To gain some esteem.
 <rindolf>  I contacted an Israeli publisher about publishing some of my
            stories and/or essays, but they didn't return to me after more
            than a month (which is their designated limit).
 <rindolf>  And after reminding them on the phone, I gave up.
 <rindolf>  Well, I'm not going to sit idly and expect recognition to come
            to me.
 <rindolf>  Maybe I'll use some of my Project Wonderful money to gain some
            publicity.
 <rindolf>  I could try publicising some of my works on various sites such
            as http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/
 <srogers>  Yeah - promote yourself
 <rindolf>  srogers: yes.
 <rindolf>  srogers: I think that was the main mistake of Howard Roark in
            The Fountainhead.
 <rindolf>  He should have worked more on publicity.
 <srogers>  ha - if only he had Facebook . . .
 <rindolf>  Heh.

     <mrout>  Who likes freedom?
     <mrout>  FREEDOM
   <rindolf>  mrout: freedom++
    <Younos>  just give me my beer
   <rindolf>  Younos: heh.
   <rindolf>  No beer for you!
    <Younos>  aww :o(
     <mrout>  I’m in non-freedom mode atm actually, using Windoze
     <mrout>  for teh gamez
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
     <mrout>  but when I restart into Linux I respect the freedoms of
              myself and others
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
    <Younos>  you should respect it regardless of the platform
   <rindolf>  mrout: maybe try reporting it as a bug in WINE/etc.
   <rindolf>  mrout: the GNU project encourages FOSS developers to port
              their software to non-free platforms.
   <rindolf>  Though there was a small backlash about it (at least for
              Windows) a while ago.
 <alfplayer>  encourages?
     <mrout>  rindolf: I sure hope it does. if we can encourage users to
              try FOSS software on non-free platforms, they might more
              easily learn about FOSS and about how to protect their
              freedoms
   <rindolf>  http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html - I provide a
              Windows binary for this. :-)
     <mrout>  Many users don’t even know they can get software that
              respects their freedoms.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: well, don't know if encourage, but it doesn't
              hold a stand against it.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: and a lot of GNU software can be built fine on
              Windows (And proprietary UNIXes).
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: that's very different imo
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: yes, like gcc and emacs
     <mrout>  btw is rms ever on here? He gave a talk at my local
              university a few years ago, and I never got a chance to talk

              - also see this.
     <mrout>  lol
   <rindolf>  mrout: I don't think he uses IRC.
   <rindolf>  mrout: he also doesn't use a graphical web browser.
   <rindolf>  mrout: though he does read the web sometimes.
     <mrout>  rindolf: i haven’t installed X yet, so neither do I. haha
   <rindolf>  He commented on a few pages on my site.
   <rindolf>  When he visited Israel, I told RMS that I felt making
              Freecell Solver Public Domain (now it's MIT/X11L) was
              appropriate given its target audience, and he said he
              thought making it GPLed would encourage more users of
              programs that used it to make them FOSS.
   <rindolf>  He also said it was OK that freshmeat.net (now freecode.com)
              did not release their backend as free software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
     <mrout>  freecode.com?
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, I think he doesn't even use links or lynx or
              Emacs' www-mode.
   <rindolf>  mrout: yes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they changed their name and domain.
     <mrout>  who are they? NEVER heard of them
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://freecode.com/ - it's a nice way to discover
              some interesting software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they are a web-directory for UNIX software.
     <mrout>  do they host it?
   <rindolf>  mrout: no.
     <mrout>  quite unlike something like github, then?
   <rindolf>  mrout: just link to it.
     <mrout>  cool
     <mrout>  will try to remember that
   <rindolf>  mrout: also see
              http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/freshmeat_effect.html
   <rindolf>  mrout: not everything there is FOSS.
      <mtjm>  http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html explains his Web
              use
   <rindolf>  mrout: and not everything is there.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but I try to publicise most of my major software
              there.
      <mtjm>  IRC would need a constant network access which is difficult
              when travelling (and needs much mor e time than batch mail
              writing)
   <rindolf>  Well, most of the software published there is either niche
              or quite boring.
     <mrout>  rindolf: Freecell Solver on freecode is the first result
   <rindolf>  mrout: for what?
     <mrout>  that google search
     <mrout>  I fail to see a problem
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, thing is there are other Freecell solvers.
   <rindolf>  mrout: and what I said is that I clog the search.
     <mrout>  Oh, I see what you mean
     <mrout>  that’s a good thing for you, though
   <rindolf>  mrout: lots of junk like
              FreeBSD/Debian/Ubuntu/Mandriva/Mageia packages.
   <rindolf>  mrout: that's what I call the freshmeat effect.
   <rindolf>  I get http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ as the first hit. :-(

     <mrout>  New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but shlomifish.org is hosted in hostgator.com .
   <rindolf>  I used to host it in a small Israeli hosting provider but
              they were too unreliable.
     <mrout>  I asked, because i expected it to be US, and so I’d say “I
              know what US stands for, but you don’t know what NZ stands
              for? Shame on you.”
   <rindolf>  mrout: I know that .nz is New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but didn't understand the initialism in the context.
   <rindolf>  mrout: some Americans think .il is Illinois.
   <rindolf>  And .ca is California.
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .la.

     <mrout>  yeah
     <mrout>  Woo tokelau
           *  rindolf wonders if there is .fs.
   <rindolf>  There should be a country called .if so I can register

   <rindolf>  Someone registered shlomifi.sh. ;-)
   <rindolf>  Not me, though.
   <rindolf>  https://www.google.com/search?q=.lf - no .lf either.
   <rindolf>  We need more countries.
     <mrout>  I wish there was a .ut
     <mrout>  so I could get mro.ut
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Well, I can register shlomif.name.
     <mrout>  I already have rout.co.nz (that’s my dad’s actually) and
              rout.geek.nz (mine)
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Are top-level .nz domains available?
   <rindolf>  like rout.nz
     <mrout>  you can’t get milesroutisawesome.nz, no
   <rindolf>  Ah.
     <mrout>  or rout.nz >.>
   <rindolf>  OK.
   <rindolf>  .il domains are kinda costly and they used to require
              faxing.
   <rindolf>  And I don't feel my domains are particularly
              Israeli-related.
     <mrout>  ahh
   <rindolf>  Well, I originally got shlomif.il.eu.org.
   <rindolf>  But its DNS was flaky.
     <mrout>  .eu.org?
   <rindolf>  So I ended up buying shlomifish.org
     <mrout>  what’s your actual name?
   <rindolf>  Now I also have shlomifish.com
   <rindolf>  mrout: Shlomi Fish.
     <mrout>  Ahh
   <rindolf>  mrout: eu.org is free DNS.
     <mrout>  ?
   <rindolf>  But I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: it's not .eu (European union).
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://eu.org/
     <mrout>  that site’s odd
     <mrout>  what’s wrong with .eu
     <mrout>  shit a brick, they want a separate ccTLD for
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin_(France)
   <rindolf>  mrout: nothing is wrong with .eu - it's just that eu.org is
              something different.
   <rindolf>  eu.org predates .eu.
     <mrout>  ahh
     <mrout>  it annoys me that the US doesn’t use .us more
     <mrout>  and clutters .com
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .gov, .net, .org...
   <rindolf>  .mil
   <rindolf>  .navy
     <mrout>  exactly
   <rindolf>  mrout: I also have http://shlom.in/
     <mrout>  it’s pretty americo-centric
   <rindolf>  Could not get http://shlom.fi/ because my domain registrar
              did not have it.
   <rindolf>  shlom.in is my own custom (and private) URL shortener.
   <rindolf>  Some overzealous spam filters blocked it.
   <rindolf>  Ah, domains.
   <rindolf>  The bread and butter of Internet conversations.
     <mrout>  lol
   <rindolf>  I know someone who has http://ali.as/
   <rindolf>  Well, from the Internet.
   <rindolf>  And there's also cr.yp.to which is Dan Bernstein.
   <rindolf>  DJB.
     <mrout>  domains, vim vs emacs and hello_there vs helloThere.
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is cool
   <rindolf>  mrout: and tabs vs. spaces.
     <mrout>  but hard to type
     <mrout>  eugh
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is hard to type
     <mrout>  spaces, vim, hello_there or HelloThere, but never
              helloThere.
   <rindolf>  Since I have http://perl-begin.org/ and want to create a
              site for Vim beginners, I should get a good domain.
   <rindolf>  vim.perl-begin.org or vim.shlomifish.org does not look good.

   <rindolf>  Heh. begin.tel is available. \o/
     <mrout>  i’d love mil.es
   <rindolf>  Not that I want it.
     <mrout>  begin.tel?
     <mrout>  begintel?
     <mrout>  $17/yr for mil.es
     <mrout>  YES FUCK YES
   <rindolf>  OK, I registered begin-site.org and begin-site.com
   <rindolf>  On https://www.domainsite.com/ .
   <rindolf>  I figured most people won't "guess" begin-site.net... ;-)
     <mrout>  nice
   <rindolf>  So I'll have http://vim.begin-site.com/ and
              http://vim.begin-site.org/
     <mrout>  what about rindolf.com
     <mrout>  begin-site seems a bit clunky
   <rindolf>  mrout: rindolf is only my IRC nickname.
     <mrout>  still
   <rindolf>  mrout: and I already have www.shlomifish.org
   <rindolf>  mrout: I don't see why most people will STFW for "rindolf"
              or "shlomi fish" or whatever.
   <rindolf>  Most of the people come to my site using more generic
              searches.
   <rindolf>  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fountainhead%20parody - first hit
              !
     <mrout>  STFW?
   <rindolf>  mrout: search the fab web.
   <rindolf>  Like RTFM.
   <rindolf>  Using Google, Duck Duck go, Bing or whatever.
     <mrout>  fucking web, I assume
   <rindolf>  mrout: true.
   <rindolf>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Freecell_Solver -
              this was deleted because it was not notable enough.
              F****king deletionists.
     <mrout>  they deleted your user page?
   <rindolf>  mrout: no, only /wiki/Freecell_Solver
     <mrout>  oh
   <rindolf>  mrout: access the link - it's there.
   <rindolf>  Just not visible on default searches.
     <mrout>  “lacks references showing notability” you mean apart from
              the fact it’s the top google result for Freecell Solver?
              FUUUUU wikipedians
   <rindolf>  I restored it before it was deleted.
   <rindolf>  mrout:
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_Dozen_%28solitaire%29
              - some people on #wikipedia (or #wikipedia-en) told me this
              may not be notable.
   <rindolf>  There are a zillion pages about it.
   <rindolf>  And Wikipedia covers almost any other Solitaire variant.
     <mrout>  lol, fucking wikipedia
   <rindolf>  Yes.
     <mrout>  articles about every steeple in Italy, but not about ever
              solitaire variant
     <mrout>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_Dozen_%28solitaire%29#Solvers
   <rindolf>  mrout: also about football players.
     <mrout>  your article should be restored
   <rindolf>  mrout: yes, maybe.
     <mrout>  I’d almost be convinced to do it myself
   <rindolf>  mrout: are you a wikipedian?
     <mrout>  sort of
     <mrout>  I have an account
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, I added the [[Freecell Solver]] link.
   <rindolf>  Hoping someone will fill it in.
   <rindolf>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell#Solvers - there is a
              cursory mention of it there.
     <mrout>  mmm
   <rindolf>  mrout: this section was deleted previously because it was
              not "Encyclopedic enough."
   <rindolf>  mrout: that Wikipedian had tons of complaints against him on
              his user talk page.
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen - this
              used to be about the Perl developer (and co-author of
              several books).
   <rindolf>  Now it's about an olympic athelete.
   <rindolf>  Well, I added that page, and people enhanced it, but then it
              was deleted. :-(
     <mrout>  not even an olympic athelete
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah, yes, just world competition.
     <mrout>  didn’t even place
     <mrout>  compared to an author and developer of one of the most
              popular programming languages
     <mrout>  :/
   <rindolf>  Yes.
   <rindolf>  Oh well, Wikipedia.
   <rindolf>  The worst encyclopedia in the world except for all others.
 <galex-713>  ?
     <mrout>  hahaha
     <mrout>  yyeah
           *  galex-713 slaps mrout
 <galex-713>  Wikipedia is perfect!
           *  galex-713 hides
     <mrout>  hardly
